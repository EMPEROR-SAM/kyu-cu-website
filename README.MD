# Kyu-CU-Website Upgrade

If you are reading this then I hope you know that the current Kirinyaga University CU Website was hosted but with very little functionality to the local user.
I have therefore embarked on a journey to make the website more useful by adding the necessary functionality so as to accomplish the set goals at the beginning of this project. I hope you will take this as a personal project to to make this project a succcess.

Below are some of the objectives we hope to accomplish by the end of this project:
1. Enabling posting of articles.
2. Making the website more responsive.
3. Decreasing the load-up time of the whole website.
4. Re-designing the whole website with the latest HTLM 5 rules.
5. Optimizing the offline functionality of the website.
6. Implementing the MPESA-API to enable automated Payments.
7. Online registration of members
8. Designing a new article page.

## Guidlines On Devopment 
This upgdrade will involve a big percentage BACK-END DEV. So to make sure we are all on the same path we should have following in mind.
* We will use **PHP OPP AND PHP PDO** 
* We will use **PHP STATEMENTS** when doing any communicaton to the database. 
_**Note**_ that all of the above are for the **security** of our website

 
 I have also created a sub-domain [TEST.KYUCU.CO.KE](https://test.kyucu.co.ke/) for testing of the website during the development process and to reduce the deployment time time at the end of the project.
